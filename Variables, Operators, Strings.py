# Exercise 1
# Script the adds 15 & 30 and divides the sum by 2. Print out the answer
a = 15
b = 30
answer = (a + b)/ 2
print(answer)
# or
print((15+30)/2)

# Exercise 2
# Initialize two variables and use arithmetic operators to add, subtract, multiply, divide, and find the remainder.
x = 10
y = 4
# + = add
print(x + y)
# - = subtract
print(x - y)
# * = multiply
print(x * y)
# / = divide
print(x / y)
# % remainder
print(x % y)

# Question 3
# Create a variable called name and store your name in it as a string.
name = "Emmanuel"

# Question 4
# Create three variables in one line and assign each one a different food item.
food1, food2, food3 = "banana", "eggs", "bread"

# Question 5
# Print out "Hello" ten times using arithmetic operators.
print("hello" * 10)

# Question 6
# Set your name and age variables in one line with multiple assignment
name, age = "Emmanuel", 29

# Question 7
# Create two strings and then create a third variable combining both of the two original strings.
string1 = "My name is Emmanuel Chuks Okoh"
string2 = "and I love playing soccer"
print(string1 + " " + string2)

# Question 8

# Question 9
# Create a string and print the letters from index 0 to 5.
string1 = "Emmanuel"
print(string1[0:6])

# Question 10
# Create a variable and print all the letters from the first index until the end.
string1 = "Emmanuel"
